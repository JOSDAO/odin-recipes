    <h2>Description</h2>
    This Thai fried rice is called American fried rice (Khao Pad American) in Thailand, <br>
    because it uses ingredients that are considered American, like ketchup and bacon. <br>
    It is very popular in Thailand and easy to make. All ingredients should be prepped in <br>
    advance cause once you start frying the rice, it goes fast. If people are really hungry, <br>
    you can serve a fried egg on top of the fried rice.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices bacon, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, cubed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh pineapple</li>
        <li>5 cups cooked jasmine rice, cooled</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper</li>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Garnish</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cucumber, sliced</li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        <li>1 lime, cut into wedges</li>
        <li>4 green Thai chile peppers</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat a large skillet or wok over medium heat and cook bacon until browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Drain, reserving bacon grease in a bowl. Spoon 2 tablespoons grease back into the skillet.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to medium-high and cook garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add onion and cook, stirring often, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir in tomato and pineapple and stir-fry until warmed through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to high and add 1 tablespoon bacon grease. Add rice and stir-fry, breaking up with a spatula so it gets coated well with bacon grease. Cook for about 3 minutes. Season with ketchup, soy sauce, sugar, and white pepper.</li>
        <li>Move rice mixture to one side of the skillet or wok and pour beaten eggs onto the empty side. Stir-fry until eggs are almost set, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix eggs with rice mixture. Fold in bacon bits. Serve with cucumber, green onions, cilantro, lemon wedges, and chile peppers.</li>
    </ol>
