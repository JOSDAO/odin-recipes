    <h2>Description</h2>
    This garlic chicken is simple to make â€” just dip and bake. Garlicky goodness in a breaded chicken dish. Yum!
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan over low heat until warmed, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour into a shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese in a separate shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Use tongs to dip chicken breasts in olive oil-garlic mixture, then coat evenly in bread crumb mixture. Transfer coated chicken to a shallow baking dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink and juices run clear, 30 to 35 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
